# Mesh Decals
 An example implementation of mesh-based decals in Unity.
 The decal mesh is generated by clipping the triangles of any intersecting meshes against a unit cube. The result is a decal mesh which in-theory is much cheaper to render than a decal projected at runtime. The mesh-based approach also allows decals to use simple materials and receive lighting without reliance on Gbuffers or reconstructed normals from depth.
 
 ## Disclaimer
 This is in no-way a finished product and the goal of this project was to explore the various algorithms involved. The code has been kept relatively simple with decent documentation to serve as an example should you wish to build a similar system for your own projects. While things are at a good stopping point, I may update this project to tackle some remaining TODOs such as mesh simplification and some potential optimizations.
